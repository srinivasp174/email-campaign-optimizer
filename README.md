# Email Campaign Optimizer

## Project Overview

This project analyzes email marketing campaign data to optimize click-through rates through machine learning. By identifying patterns in user behavior and email characteristics, we help marketers shift from random email sending to data-driven targeted approaches.

## Business Objectives

1. **Campaign Performance Analysis**: Calculate email open rates and click-through rates
2. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop models that predict which users are most likely to click on email links
3. **Targeting Optimization**: Quantify potential improvements from targeted sending
4. **Segment Discovery**: Identify high-performing user segments for marketing insights

## Key Findings

### Campaign Metrics

- **Open Rate**: Percentage of recipients who opened the email
- **Click Rate**: Percentage of recipients who clicked links within emails
- **Click-to-Open Rate**: Percentage of email openers who clicked links

### Segment Analysis

Our analysis revealed several interesting patterns across different user segments:

- **Email Content**: Short vs. long email text performance differences
- **Personalization**: Impact of personalized vs. generic greetings
- **Timing**: Optimal hours and days for sending campaigns
- **Geography**: Variations in engagement across different countries
- **Purchase History**: Correlation between past purchases and email engagement

### Model Performance

We built and compared multiple machine learning models:

1. **Logistic Regression**: Baseline model with balanced class weights
2. **Random Forest**: Ensemble approach with improved performance
3. **XGBoost**: Best-performing model with optimized hyperparameters

### Improvement Potential

- Our best model can identify the top 20% of users most likely to click
- When targeting only these users, we expect a significant improvement in click-through rates
- The enhancement strategy is fully testable via A/B testing methodology

## Technical Implementation

### Data Pipeline

1. **Data Loading and Integration**: Combining email, open, and click data
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating target variables and transforming features
3. **Preprocessing**: Encoding, scaling, and preparing data for modeling
4. **Model Development**: Training models with hyperparameter tuning
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using multiple metrics

### Hyperparameter Optimization

All models were optimized using:

- **Logistic Regression**: GridSearchCV for exhaustive parameter search
- **Random Forest & XGBoost**: RandomizedSearchCV for efficient exploration

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Overall prediction correctness
- **Precision**: Proportion of correct positive predictions
- **Recall**: Proportion of actual positives correctly identified
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **ROC AUC**: Model discrimination ability

## Expected Business Impact

### Targeted Sending Strategy

By implementing the model-driven targeting approach:

- **Increased Efficiency**: Focusing efforts on users most likely to engage
- **Higher ROI**: Improved click rates with the same number of emails
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Reducing unwanted emails to uninterested users

### A/B Testing Methodology

To validate our approach, we recommend:

1. Dividing users into two equal groups
2. Sending to group A using model-based targeting
3. Sending to group B randomly (current approach)
4. Measuring click-through rates for both groups
5. Comparing results to quantify actual improvement

## Future Directions

1. **Deeper Personalization**: Tailoring email content based on user preferences
2. **Time Optimization**: Determining optimal sending times for each user
3. **Content Testing**: A/B testing different email formats and messaging
4. **Dynamic Modeling**: Regularly updating models as new data becomes available

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Jupyter Notebook environment
